# MyRead

This is a simple react application to keep track of your reading. You have 3 options per book, either `Currently Reading`, `Want to Read`, and `Read`. You can add books with the plus sign on the bottom right and remove each book individually

`Your data is not presistant`

## TL;DR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Scheercuzy/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter
npm install
npm start
```

A browser page should open up after `npm start` and you should be able to categorize your books.
